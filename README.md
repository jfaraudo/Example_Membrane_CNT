# Examples of Water flow across a membrane made with carbon nanotubes using NAMD
Examples of NAMD simulations, execution and analysis based on an extension of the official NAMD tutorial "Simulation of Water Permeation through Nanotubes":
https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd-index.html 

## List of Examples

- case 1:
Files corresponding to simulations in which an initially dry CNT membrane is put in contact with water in one side. 

- case 2:
Files corresponding to simulations in which we study equilibrium and nonequilibrium flow of water in a CNT membrane in contact with water in both sides.
