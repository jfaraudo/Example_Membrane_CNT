# Membrane made with 4 CNTs
The membrane is made by four CNTs centered at (-8.625 ,-5,0) ,  (-8.625 ,5,0), (2.875,-5,0) and (-2.875,5,0)
It can be build easy with e.g. VMD by creating a CNT centered at (0,0,0) and moving that CNT at the desired position with the Tkconsole and the moveby command.
Once generated, the different CNTs can be merged with the VMD option "merge"
