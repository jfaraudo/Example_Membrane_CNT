## Force Field (inp) and structure/coordinates (psf/pdb) input files

The pdb/psf were generated in the build folder (the CNT membrane with added water)

The inp files were extracted from CHARMM force field (data for carbon atoms and for TIP3P model of water)

Updated standard CHARMM files available at
